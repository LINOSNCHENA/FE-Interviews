Filters:

User should be able to filter the start and end dates from the UI. Api
response will not change but the data should be filtered on front-end side.
Charts to Implement


Use the "Time Series (Daily)" keys as the date and "4. close" as values from
the API response and transform the data into the following charts:


1. Min-Max Area Range Chart: The x-axis should show the month and day, y-axis would
be calculated following values.
1. Min-max range: Display the min and max values for each day of the year.
Calculate for the same month-same day different years values min-max range
between the start date until end of the previous year and display the range on the
chart.
2. Current year line: Display the current year values as a line chart on the same
graph.
